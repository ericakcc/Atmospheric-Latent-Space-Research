# Atmospheric Latent Space Research

This repository focuses on exploring the latent space of atmospheric parameters using Variational Autoencoders (VAE). The primary goal is to understand the underlying patterns and structures in atmospheric data, specifically focusing on Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE).

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To study the latent space representations of CAPE using VAE.
- **Approach**: Implement a VAE model to learn and visualize the latent space of atmospheric data.

## Data

- **CAPE Data**: Includes temperature profiles, moisture content, and pressure levels.
